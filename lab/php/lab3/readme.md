# Lab 3: How to run PHP on Visual Studio Code

# Download the file phpweb.zip

Download the file `phpweb.zip`.

This lab exercise will introduce you to PHP files. Make sure you have XAMPP installed. You must have Apache Web Server running in order for PHP code to be processed. Please ensure that your XAMPP is configured as follows.

Please download the [phpweb.zip](https://elearning.utm.my/21222/draftfile.php/78793/user/draft/333303570/phpweb.zip) PHP source code file. When you unzip this file, you will see two folders: `exercise` and `msoWP`. This file should be placed in the `XAMPP/htdocs` folder. You will be using the `exercise` folder (Figure 1.2) in this exercise lab.

![Figure 1.2: Exercise folder](https://elearning.utm.my/21222/draftfile.php/78793/user/draft/333303570/Screenshot%202022-05-28%20at%201.08.57%20PM.png)

Please open the `exercise` folder in Visual Studio Code. The following are the outcomes of the implementation (Figure 1.3).

# Hello World in PHP

Make a file called `hello.php`. Then, in the `<body>` tag section, enter the following code:

```
<?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

![Figure 1.3: hello.php](https://elearning.utm.my/21222/draftfile.php/78793/user/draft/333303570/Screenshot%202022-05-28%20at%208.13.49%20PM.png)

Let‚Äôs break down the different components of the code. All PHP code falls within a PHP Code Block, starting with `<?php` and ending with `?>`. `echo` is a language construct. Its arguments are a list of expressions following the `echo` keyword, separated by commas and not delimited by parentheses. `echo` tells PHP to display or output whatever is included between `echo` and the ending semicolon `;`. Between the `echo` and the `;` is a sequence of characters ‚Äî `Hello, World!` ‚Äî that is enclosed in quotation marks. Any characters that are inside quotation marks...
