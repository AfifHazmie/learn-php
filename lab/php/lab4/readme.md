# Downloading and Placing "msoWP" and "exercise" Folders in htdocs

This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of downloading the "phpweb.zip" file, extracting its contents, and placing the "msoWP" and "exercise" folders into the "htdocs" folder. These folders contain PHP and MySQL code, including basic syntax, charts, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. By following these instructions, you will be able to set up and access the PHP files and code within these folders on your local web server.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Downloading the "phpweb.zip" file**
- Go to the download location of the "phpweb.zip" file.
- Click on the download link to initiate the download.

**Step 2: Extracting the contents of the "phpweb.zip" file**
- Locate the downloaded "phpweb.zip" file on your computer.
- Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" or use a file extraction software of your choice.
- This will create a folder named "phpweb" containing the "exercise" and "msoWP" folders.

**Step 3: Placing the "msoWP" and "exercise" folders in htdocs**
- Open your file explorer and navigate to the "htdocs" folder. The "htdocs" folder is typically located in the root directory of your web server.
- Copy the "exercise" folder from the extracted "phpweb" folder.
- Paste the "exercise" folder into the "htdocs" folder.
- Next, copy the "msoWP" folder from the extracted "phpweb" folder.
- Paste the "msoWP" folder into the "htdocs" folder.

After completing these steps, both the "msoWP" and "exercise" folders will be successfully placed inside the "htdocs" folder on your web server. You can now access the PHP files and code within these folders by using your web server's local address.
