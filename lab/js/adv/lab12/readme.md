# Lab 12: Sidebar Menu Templates

A sidebar menu is a commonly used user interface element in web design. It is a vertical navigation menu that appears on the left or right side of a web page and typically displays links to various sections of a website. 

Sidebar menu templates in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are pre-designed code snippets that developers can use to quickly and easily create a sidebar menu on their web pages. These templates often include styles for basic functionality such as hover effects, active states, and responsive design for mobile devices. 

Some common features and techniques used in creating sidebar menu templates:

1. HTML Markup: The HTML structure of the sidebar menu typically consists of an unordered list (ul) with nested list items (li) to represent the menu items. Each list item can have an anchor tag (a) with a hyperlink to the relevant page.

2. CSS Styling: CSS is used to style the menu items, including setting the font, color, background, and positioning of the menu. CSS is also used to create hover effects, which are applied to a menu item when the user hovers over it with their cursor. Active states can also be styled with CSS, which indicates the currently selected menu item.

3. JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript can be used to add interactivity to the sidebar menu, such as adding a toggle button to open and close the menu on smaller devices. This is commonly referred to as a "hamburger" menu. JavaScript can also be used to animate the opening and closing of the menu.

Some popular libraries and frameworks that offer pre-built sidebar menu templates include Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize. Developers can also create their own custom sidebar menu templates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
