# Lab 12: Text and Box Model

The Text and Box models in CSS are important concepts that form the basis of layout and design in web development.

## Text Model:

The Text Model in CSS is concerned with the rendering of text content within an element. It consists of four properties:

1. Font: The font property specifies the typeface, size, weight, and style of the text content.

2. Text color: The color property specifies the color of the text content.

3. Text alignment: The text-align property specifies the horizontal alignment of the text content within an element.

4. Line-height: The line-height property specifies the height of each line of text within an element.

Together, these properties allow developers to control the appearance and layout of text content within an HTML document.

**Sample code**:

1. Css:
```html
<p class="text-example">This is an example of styled text</p>
```
2. HTML
```html
.text-example {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #333333;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

In the above example, we have defined a paragraph element with a class of "text-example". In the CSS, we have applied various properties to this class to style the text content within the paragraph. We have specified the font family, size, weight, and color of the text, as well as the text alignment and line-height.

## Box Model:

The Box Model in CSS is concerned with the layout and positioning of elements on a web page. It consists of four components:

1. Content: The content area is the actual area where the content of the element is displayed.

2. Padding: The padding area is the space between the content and the element's border.

3. Border: The border area is a thin line that surrounds the padding and content areas.

4. Margin: The margin area is the space between the border of an element and the adjacent elements.

By adjusting the dimensions of each of these components, developers can control the size, spacing, and positioning of elements on a web page. The Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and is used extensively in layout and design.

**Sample code**:

1. HTML:
```html
<div class="box-example">
  <p>This is an example of a box with padding, border, and margin</p>
</div>
```
2. CSS:
```html
.box-example {
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #333333;
  margin: 20px;
}
```

In the above example, we have defined a div element with a class of "box-example". In the CSS, we have applied various properties to this class to define the dimensions, background color, padding, border, and margin of the element. We have specified a width and height of 400px and 200px respectively, and added a gray background color. We have also added 20px of padding, a 1px solid black border, and 20px of margin around the element. The resulting box will be displayed as a rectangle with text content inside, surrounded by padding, a border, and margin.

## Task
Your task is to change the appearance of text using CSS. The following is the original interface:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/learn-php/blob/main/lab/css/lab12/download/lab12a.png"  height="600" />
</p>


- The file [üíæ lab12.zip](./download/lab12.zip) is available for download. This file contains the files lab11.html and utm_logo.png. In the lab11.html file, please enter your CSS code. You are not permitted to make any changes to the HTML file that has been provided. CSS code can be entered in the `<style>` tag: 

```html
<style>
/* your css */
</style>
```
- Part of the HTML code is as follows:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/learn-php/blob/main/lab/css/lab12/download/lab12b.png"  height="400" />
</p>

## Output

You must create the interface as shown below.

</p>

### Lab 5: Box Model 2

- Using the box model concept, Lab 5 will create a box.
- *Box2*, *item1*, and *item2* are the three classes that are used.
- The *box2* class is used to create boxes with a *greenyellow* border.
- The *item1* and *item2* classes are used to modify the appearance of the box's contents.
- Please create a box like the image below.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/learn-php/blob/main/lab/css/lab12/download/lab12h.png"  width="600" />
</p>

### Lab 6: Box Model 3

- To generate a box for Lab 6, four ids or classes are used.
box3 is the id for creating a model box. This box is located in the centre of the page. This box's information is a 3 px border that is solid and rgb coloured (42, 75, 165). The background colour is rgba (1, 247, 177, 0.483) and the size is 500px.
- The photo class, text2 id, and text3 class are all contained within the model box. The photo class is used to alter the appearance of the utm logo.png image by adding a 5px dotted border and coloured rgb pixels (251, 0, 255).
- The id text2 is used to create a box with a 6 px dashed and rgb-colored border (248, 80, 3). This box text content can be scrolled.
- The text3 class is used to make text bold or underlined.

<p align="center">
