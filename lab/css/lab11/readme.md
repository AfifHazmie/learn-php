# Lab 11: HTML Text Appearance

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a styling language used to describe the presentation of HTML or XML documents. With CSS, we can modify the appearance of text. Text appearance refers to the visual styling properties applied to the text content of a web page. These properties can include font family, font size, font weight, line height, text color, text decoration, text alignment, and more. For example, the font-family property can be used to specify the font type, such as *Arial* or *Times New Roman*. The font-size property can be used to specify the size of the font, such as 12px or 1em. The color property can be used to specify the color of the text, such as `red` or `#FF0000`.

Additionally, we can use CSS properties to change the style of the text, such as font-weight for **bold**, font-style for *italic*, and text-decoration for underline. We can also apply text shadows, adjust letter spacing, and modify the line height, among other things.

Here's an example of how to use CSS to set the text appearance of a paragraph:

```html
<style>
  /* set the font family to Arial */
  p {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }
  
  /* set the font size to 18 pixels */
  p {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
  
  /* set the font weight to bold */
  p {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  
  /* set the line height to 1.5 */
  p {
    line-height: 1.5;
  }
  
  /* set the text color to red */
  p {
    color: red;
  }
  
  /* set the text decoration to underline */
  p {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
  
  /* set the text alignment to center */
  p {
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>

<p>This is an example paragraph with text appearance styles applied.</p>
```

In this example, the CSS code sets the font family to *Arial*, the font size to 18 pixels, the font weight to bold, the line height to 1.5, the text color to red, the text decoration to underline, and the text alignment to center for the paragraph element. The actual appearance of the text will depend on the browser and device being used to view the page.

## Task

Your task is to use CSS to change the appearance of text. The following is the text:

```html
UTM has three campuses ‚Äì the main campus is in Skudai, and was the first university in the state of Johor.
