## Project Description

For the final project, your group will develop a functional data-centric online system using PHP. The minimum requirements for the implemented system are as follows:

1. The developed system must be functional and operated online.
2. The developed system must be data-centric and connected to a database.
3. The developed system must be implemented using the programming languages taught in this class, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
4. The system should not be developed through any open-source-based systems.
5. The database must consist of at least five tables.
6. The developed system must incorporate the following capabilities:
   - Data Manipulation capabilities
   - Sorting and Searching capabilities
   - User Verification capabilities
   - Varied User Access/Level capabilities
7. You may also incorporate:
   - Cookie
   - Any added functions, such as input validation using JavaScript (highlight during presentation)
   - A clean, consistent, and attractive presentation using HTML and CSS.

We suggest using the word "system" instead of "answer file" in instruction 3 for clarity. Also, we suggest using Markdown file format for the final project report for a better presentation.
