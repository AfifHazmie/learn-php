# Operators and Expressions

In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform actions on values or variables. There are arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=), comparison operators (==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=), logical operators (&&, ||, !), bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>), and others. Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that are evaluated to produce a single value. They can be simple (such as a single variable) or complex (such as a combination of multiple operators and variables). Understanding operators and expressions is crucial for writing effective and efficient JavaScript code.

## Operators
Operators are symbols or keywords that perform actions on one or more operands (values or variables) and produce a result. Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder) operations. Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables or modify existing values. Comparison operators are used to compare two values or variables and return a Boolean value (true or false) depending on the comparison result. Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and return a Boolean value based on the result of the conditions. Bitwise operators are used to manipulate the binary representation of values.

Operators play a crucial role in JavaScript programming as they help to perform various operations on values and variables. Understanding how to use and combine operators is essential for writing effective and efficient JavaScript code.

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description | Code Example |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| +        | Addition    | `let a = 5 + 3;` (a will be 8) |
| -        | Subtraction | `let b = 10 - 2;` (b will be 8) |
| *        | Multiplication | `let c = 2 * 6;` (c will be 12) |
| /        | Division | `let d = 20 / 5;` (d will be 4) |
| %        | Modulus (remainder) | `let e = 17 % 5;` (e will be 2) |

### 2. Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description | Code Example |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| =        | Assignment | `let f = 3;` (f will be 3) |
| +=       | Addition assignment | `let g = 4; g += 2;` (g will be 6) |
| -=       | Subtraction assignment | `let h = 7; h -= 3;` (h will be 4) |
| *=       | Multiplication assignment | `let i = 2; i *= 4;` (i will be 8) |
| /=       | Division assignment | `let j = 20; j /= 5;` (j will be 4) |
| %=       | Modulus assignment | `let k = 17; k %= 5;` (k will be 2) |

### 3. Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Code Example |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| ==       | Equality comparison | `let l = 5; let m = '5'; if (l == m) { ... }` |
| !=       | Inequality comparison | `let n = 6; let o = '5'; if (n != o) { ... }` |
| ===      | Strict equality comparison | `let p = 5; let q = '5'; if (p === q) { ... }` |
| !==      | Strict inequality comparison | `let r = 6; let s = '5'; if (r !== s) { ... }` |
| >        | Greater than comparison | `if (a > b) { ... }` |
| <        | Less than comparison | `if (c < d) { ... }` |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to comparison | `if (e >= f) { ... }` |
| <=       | Less than or equal to comparison | `if (g <= h) { ... }` |

### 4. Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Code Example |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| &&       | Logical AND | `if (a > 0 && b < 10) { ... }` |
| \|\|      | Logical OR | `if (a > 0 || b < 10) { ... }` |
| !        | Logical NOT | `if (!a) { ... }` |
