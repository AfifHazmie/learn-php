# Operators and Expressions

In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform actions on values or variables. There are arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=), comparison operators (==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=), logical operators (&&, ||, !), bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>), and others. Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that are evaluated to produce a single value. They can be simple (such as a single variable) or complex (such as a combination of multiple operators and variables). Understanding operators and expressions is crucial for writing effective and efficient JavaScript code.
