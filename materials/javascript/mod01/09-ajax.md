# AJAX and APIs


AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique in web development that allows you to send and receive data from a web server without reloading the entire page. It allows you to update parts of a web page without interrupting the user's interaction with the page. AJAX is accomplished by using a combination of JavaScript and HTTP requests.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. They define how software components should interact with each other. In the context of web development, APIs are often used to allow communication between different web applications or services.

In JavaScript, you can use AJAX to send and receive data from an API. This allows you to use the data provided by the API to dynamically update the content of your web page without the need for a page refresh. 

For example, you can use the XMLHttpRequest object in JavaScript to send an HTTP request to an API endpoint and receive a response. You can then use the response to update the content of your web page. Alternatively, you can use the fetch() method introduced in ES6 to make HTTP requests to APIs and receive responses as promises.
