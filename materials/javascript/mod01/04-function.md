# Functions

In JavaScript, a function is a block of code that can be executed when it is called. Functions can be defined and called in a variety of ways, making them a fundamental building block of JavaScript programming.

Functions can be defined using the "function" keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses. The body of the function is enclosed in curly braces {} and may contain any number of statements. For example, the following function takes two parameters and returns their sum:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
## Function expressions
Functions can also be defined as function expressions, which are similar to variable assignments. 

```javascript
const multiplyNumbers = function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```
## Call function 
Functions can be called by their name followed by parentheses containing any arguments required by the function. 

```javascript
const result = addNumbers(2, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 5

const product = multiplyNumbers(4, 5);
console.log(product); // Output: 20
```
## Passed as arguments to other functions
Functions can also be passed as arguments to other functions, making them very versatile. 

```javascript
function doOperation(a, b, operation) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

const result = doOperation(4, 5, addNumbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 9

const product = doOperation(4, 5, multiplyNumbers);
console.log(product); // Output: 20
```

Functions can also have default parameter values, rest parameters, and destructured parameters, which make them even more flexible.

Overall, functions are a powerful feature of JavaScript that enable developers to write reusable and modular code.

## Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Function Example</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Function Example</h1>

	<p>Enter two numbers:</p>
	<input type="number" id="num1">
	<input type="number" id="num2">
	<button onclick="addNumbers()">Add</button>

	<p>Result: <span id="result"></span></p>

	<script>
		function addNumbers() {
			// Get the input values
			const num1 = parseInt(document.getElementById('num1').value);
			const num2 = parseInt(document.getElementById('num2').value);

			// Add the numbers together
			const sum = num1 + num2;

			// Update the result span with the sum
			document.getElementById('result').innerText = sum;
		}
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a simple HTML page with two input fields for numbers and a button to add them together. When the button is clicked, it calls the `addNumbers()` function defined in the JavaScript code. 

The `addNumbers()` function gets the values from the input fields, adds them together, and updates the result span with the sum. 

Note that the function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses containing any parameters. In this case, the function doesn't have any parameters, but it could if needed. 

The function is called by adding an `onclick` attribute to the button HTML element, which tells the browser to execute the `addNumbers()` function when the button is clicked.
