# Libraries and Frameworks

In JavaScript, a library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks without having to write the code from scratch. A framework, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive tool that provides a set of rules and guidelines to help developers build applications quickly and efficiently.

Some popular JavaScript libraries include jQuery, React, Vue.js, and AngularJS. These libraries offer a range of functionality, from simplifying DOM manipulation to providing a complete user interface framework.

Frameworks like Node.js, Express.js, and Meteor.js are popular in the backend development world. They provide a comprehensive set of tools for building web applications, from managing HTTP requests to database access and templating.

One of the advantages of using libraries and frameworks is that they can save time and effort for developers. Instead of reinventing the wheel for each project, developers can use pre-existing tools to accomplish common tasks more quickly and easily. Additionally, many libraries and frameworks have large communities of developers contributing to their development, which can lead to more robust and reliable code.

However, it's important to note that using libraries and frameworks can also come with some downsides. For example, relying too heavily on external code can make it difficult to maintain and debug applications, especially if updates to the library or framework break existing functionality. Additionally, some libraries and frameworks may not be well-suited to every project, and developers may need to spend time evaluating their options to find the best fit for a particular use case.

## JavaScript libraries

| No. | Library | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | jQuery | A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library for DOM manipulation and event handling |
| 2 | React | A JavaScript library for building user interfaces |
| 3 | Vue.js | A progressive framework for building user interfaces |
| 4 | AngularJS | A JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications |
| 5 | D3.js | A JavaScript library for visualizing data using HTML, SVG, and CSS |
| 6 | Three.js | A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics on the web |
| 7 | Chart.js | A simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library for creating interactive charts and graphs |
| 8 | Moment.js | A JavaScript library for working with dates and times |
| 9 | Axios | A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests in JavaScript |
| 10 | Lodash | A JavaScript utility library providing functions for common programming tasks |

### jQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It provides an easy-to-use API for traversing and manipulating HTML documents, handling events, and creating animations.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>jQuery Example</title>
	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
	<!-- Include the jQuery library from a CDN -->
	<script>
		$(document).ready(function() {
			// Code to run when the document is ready
			$("button").click(function() {
				// Code to run when a button is clicked
				$("p").toggle(); // Toggle the visibility of all paragraphs
			});
		});
	</script>
	<!-- Include a script tag with your jQuery code -->
</head>
<body>
	<h1>jQuery Example</h1>
	<button>Toggle Paragraphs</button>
	<!-- A button to trigger the jQuery code -->
	<p>Paragraph 1</p>
	<p>Paragraph 2</p>
	<!-- Two paragraphs to manipulate with jQuery -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we first include the jQuery library from a CDN by adding a script tag with the source URL. We then write our jQuery code inside a script tag with the "document.ready" function. This function ensures that the jQuery code runs only after the document has finished loading.

Inside the "document.ready" function, we attach a click event handler to the button element. When the button is clicked, the "toggle" method is called on all paragraphs on the page, which toggles their visibility.

Overall, jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, making it a popular choice for front-end web development.
