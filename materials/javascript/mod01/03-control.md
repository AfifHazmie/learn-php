# Control Structures

In programming, control structures are used to control the flow of execution of code. JavaScript provides several control structures that enable programmers to conditionally execute code, iterate over sets of data, and handle errors. 

| Control Structure | Description | Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conditional statements | Execute code only if certain conditions are met. In JavaScript, the if statement is used for this purpose. The if statement can also be combined with else and else if clauses to create more complex conditions. | `if (condition) { code } else if (condition) { code } else { code }` |
| Loops | Execute a block of code repeatedly. JavaScript provides three types of loops: for, while, and do-while. | `for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) { code }` <br> `while (condition) { code }` <br> `do { code } while (condition)` |
| Switch statements | Execute different code based on different values of a single variable | `switch (expression) { case value: code; break; default: code; }` |
| Exception handling | JavaScript provides a try-catch-finally block for exception handling. This structure is used to handle errors that may occur during program execution. | `try { code } catch (error) { code } finally { code }` |
