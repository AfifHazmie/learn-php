# Button

Bootstrap is a popular front-end web development framework that provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript components for building responsive and mobile-friendly websites. One of the most commonly used components in Bootstrap is the button.

Bootstrap CSS classes provide a set of pre-defined styles and effects for buttons that can be easily added to HTML elements with the "btn" class. Here are some of the most commonly used Bootstrap CSS classes for buttons:

- "btn-primary": This class adds a blue background color to the button, indicating that it is the primary action the user should take on the page.

- "btn-secondary": This class adds a light gray background color to the button, indicating a secondary action or option.

- "btn-success": This class adds a green background color to the button, indicating a successful action, such as submitting a form.

- "btn-danger": This class adds a red background color to the button, indicating a dangerous or potentially harmful action, such as deleting data.

- "btn-warning": This class adds a yellow background color to the button, indicating a warning or cautionary message, such as a confirmation message.

- "btn-info": This class adds a light blue background color to the button, indicating informational content or a call-to-action.

In addition to these basic classes, Bootstrap also provides classes for different button sizes ("btn-sm", "btn-lg") and styles ("btn-outline-primary", "btn-link"), as well as utility classes for customizing button colors, borders, and other properties.

By using Bootstrap CSS classes for buttons, developers can quickly create consistent and visually appealing buttons that are optimized for different device sizes and screen resolutions.
