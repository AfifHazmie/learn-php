# Button

Bootstrap is a popular front-end web development framework that provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript components for building responsive and mobile-friendly websites. One of the most commonly used components in Bootstrap is the button.

Bootstrap CSS classes provide a set of pre-defined styles and effects for buttons that can be easily added to HTML elements with the "btn" class. Here are some of the most commonly used Bootstrap CSS classes for buttons:

Sure, I can provide the information in a table format as well. Here it is:

| Bootstrap CSS Classes | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `btn` | Adds basic styling to a button element | `<button class="btn">Click me</button>` |
| `btn-primary` | Adds blue background color to the button, indicating a primary action | `<button class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>` |
| `btn-secondary` | Adds a light gray background color to the button, indicating a secondary action or option | `<button class="btn btn-secondary">Cancel</button>` |
| `btn-success` | Adds a green background color to the button, indicating a successful action | `<button class="btn btn-success">Save</button>` |
| `btn-danger` | Adds a red background color to the button, indicating a dangerous or potentially harmful action | `<button class="btn btn-danger">Delete</button>` |
| `btn-warning` | Adds a yellow background color to the button, indicating a warning or cautionary message | `<button class="btn btn-warning">Are you sure?</button>` |
| `btn-info` | Adds a light blue background color to the button, indicating informational content or a call-to-action | `<button class="btn btn-info">Learn More</button>` |
| `btn-outline-*` | Removes the background color and applies a border of the specified color | `<button class="btn btn-outline-primary">Learn More</button>` |
| `btn-link` | Removes background and border, leaving only the link text | `<button class="btn btn-link">Read More</button>` |
| `btn-sm` | Adds small size to the button | `<button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Submit</button>` |
| `btn-lg` | Adds large size to the button | `<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Submit</button>` |

> In addition to these basic classes, Bootstrap also provides classes for different button sizes ("btn-sm", "btn-lg") and styles ("btn-outline-primary", "btn-link"), as well as utility classes for customizing button colors, borders, and other properties.

By using Bootstrap CSS classes for buttons, developers can quickly create consistent and visually appealing buttons that are optimized for different device sizes and screen resolutions.
