# Bootstrap JavaScript plugins: Tab

Tabs in Bootstrap JavaScript allow you to display multiple content sections within a single page, with each section represented by a tab that a user can click to switch between them. This can be useful for organizing large amounts of content or providing users with different views of the same data.

Bootstrap provides a simple and flexible way to create tabs using its JavaScript component. To use Tabs in Bootstrap, you need to:

1. Include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML code.
2. Add the appropriate HTML markup to define the tab structure.
3. Initialize the tab component using JavaScript.
