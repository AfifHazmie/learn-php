# Downloading Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework used for developing responsive and mobile-first web applications. To start using Bootstrap, you need to download it first. Here's how you can download Bootstrap:

1. Go to the official Bootstrap website at https://getbootstrap.com/.
2. Click on the "Download" button in the top right corner of the page.
3. Choose the version of Bootstrap that you want to download. You can choose from the compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript files or the source code.
4. Once you've selected the version you want, click on the "Download" button next to it.
5. Extract the downloaded file to your computer.
6. Inside the extracted folder, you'll find the necessary files for using Bootstrap in your web projects, such as CSS and JavaScript files, fonts, and documentation.

Alternatively, you can also use a package manager like npm or yarn to install Bootstrap in your project. This can simplify the process of managing dependencies and updating Bootstrap in the future. To install Bootstrap using npm, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```html
npm install bootstrap
```

This will install the latest version of Bootstrap and its dependencies in your project's node_modules directory. You can then include the necessary Bootstrap files in your HTML and CSS files to start using it in your project.
