# Bootstrap JavaScript plugins: Scrollspy

Scrollspy is a JavaScript plugin in Bootstrap that automatically updates the navigation links based on the scroll position of the page. This means that as a user scrolls down the page, the corresponding navigation link for the current section becomes highlighted in the navigation menu.

Scrollspy is useful for long pages that have multiple sections or a fixed navigation menu, allowing users to easily navigate through the content without having to scroll all the way back up to the top of the page.

To use Scrollspy in Bootstrap, you need to add the `data-spy="scroll"` and `data-target="#navbar"` attributes to the `body` tag and the `nav` tag respectively. The `data-spy` attribute tells Bootstrap that we want to use Scrollspy, and the `data-target` attribute tells Bootstrap which navigation menu to use for the highlighting.
