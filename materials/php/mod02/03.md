# Building a user registration and login system

This document outlines the process of building a user registration and login system for a University Academic Course Registration System. The system aims to allow students to register for user accounts securely and subsequently login to access their course registration and related information. The system will be implemented using PHP and MySQL for server-side processing and database management.

## Features

The User Registration and Login System will include the following features:

1. User Registration:
   - Students can register for an account by providing required information such as name, email, and password.
   - Account registration will validate the provided information and ensure uniqueness of email addresses.
   - Passwords will be securely hashed and stored in the database.

2. Account Activation:
   - Upon successful registration, a confirmation email will be sent to the registered email address with an activation link.
   - Users need to click on the activation link to verify and activate their account.

3. User Login:
   - Registered users can securely login to the system using their email and password.
   - Passwords will be securely verified against the stored hashed passwords.

4. User Authentication:
   - Once logged in, users will have access to their course registration and related information.
   - Authentication mechanisms will be implemented to restrict unauthorized access to user-specific data.

5. Password Reset:
   - Users will have the ability to reset their passwords in case they forget them.
   - A password reset link will be sent to the registered email address for verification and password change.

6. Database Management:
   - User information, including registration details, will be stored in a MySQL database.
   - The database will be properly structured to store user data securely.

## Conclusion

The User Registration and Login System will provide a secure and efficient way for students to register for accounts and login to the University Academic Course Registration System. By implementing proper validation, authentication, and security measures, the system will ensure the privacy and integrity of user data.
