# Building a user registration and login system

This document outlines the process of building a user registration and login system for a University Academic Course Registration System. The system aims to allow students to register for user accounts securely and subsequently login to access their course registration and related information. The system will be implemented using PHP and MySQL for server-side processing and database management.

## Features

The User Registration and Login System will include the following features:

1. User Registration:
   - Students can register for an account by providing required information such as name, email, and password.
   - Account registration will validate the provided information and ensure uniqueness of email addresses.
   - Passwords will be securely hashed and stored in the database.

2. Account Activation:
   - Upon successful registration, a confirmation email will be sent to the registered email address with an activation link.
   - Users need to click on the activation link to verify and activate their account.

3. User Login:
   - Registered users can securely login to the system using their email and password.
   - Passwords will be securely verified against the stored hashed passwords.

4. User Authentication:
   - Once logged in, users will have access to their course registration and related information.
   - Authentication mechanisms will be implemented to restrict unauthorized access to user-specific data.

5. Password Reset:
   - Users will have the ability to reset their passwords in case they forget them.
   - A password reset link will be sent to the registered email address for verification and password change.

6. Database Management:
   - User information, including registration details, will be stored in a MySQL database.
   - The database will be properly structured to store user data securely.

Certainly! Below is an example of complete PHP code for building a user registration and login system. It includes code for creating the database, designing the database structure, and implementing the registration and login functionality.

## Database Creation

```sql
CREATE DATABASE course_registration;

USE course_registration;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_active TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

## Database Design

The `users` table has the following columns:
- `id`: An auto-incrementing primary key to uniquely identify each user.
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `email`: The email address of the user, which must be unique.
- `password`: The hashed password of the user.
- `is_active`: A flag indicating whether the user's account is active or not.

## PHP Code

### registration.php

```php
<?php
// Database connection
$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'username', 'password', 'course_registration');

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Form submission
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    // Retrieve form data
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    $password = $_POST['password'];

    // Hash the password
    $hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

    // Insert user data into the database
    $sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email, password) VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$hashedPassword')";
    if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
        echo "Registration successful!";
    } else {
        echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . mysqli_error($conn);
    }

    // Close database connection
    mysqli_close($conn);
}
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>User Registration</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>User Registration</h2>
    <form method="POST" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">
        <label>Name:</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" required><br><br>
        <label>Email:</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" required><br><br>
        <label>Password:</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" required><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Register">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### login.php

```php
<?php
// Database connection
$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'username', 'password', 'course_registration');

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Form submission
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    // Retrieve form data
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    $password = $_POST['password'];

    // Retrieve user data from the database
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'";
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

    // Check if user exists
    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) === 1) {
        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
        $hashedPassword = $row['password'];

        // Verify password
        if (password_verify($password, $hashedPassword)) {
            echo "Login successful!";
        } else {
            echo "Invalid password!";
        }


    } else {
        echo "User not found!";
    }

    // Close database connection
    mysqli_close($conn);
}
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>User Login</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>User Login</h2>
    <form method="POST" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">
        <label>Email:</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" required><br><br>
        <label>Password:</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" required><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that you need to replace `'username'` and `'password'` in the `mysqli_connect` function with your own database username and password. Additionally, ensure that the PHP code and the HTML form are properly embedded within your web server environment.

This is a basic example to demonstrate the registration and login functionality. In a production system, you would need to add more security measures, input validation, error handling, and session management to enhance the security and user experience.

## Conclusion

The User Registration and Login System will provide a secure and efficient way for students to register for accounts and login to the University Academic Course Registration System. By implementing proper validation, authentication, and security measures, the system will ensure the privacy and integrity of user data.
