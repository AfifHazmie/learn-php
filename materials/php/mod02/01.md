# Introduction to PHP and MySQL syntax and installation

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and MySQL are two widely used technologies in web development. PHP is a server-side scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages, while MySQL is a popular relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data.

**PHP Syntax:**

PHP code is embedded within HTML, allowing you to mix dynamic content with static HTML markup. PHP code is enclosed within `<?php ?>` tags. Here's an example of a basic PHP script:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
  // PHP code here
  $name = "John Doe";
  echo "Hello, " . $name . "!";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

In the above example, a variable `$name` is defined and assigned the value "John Doe". The `echo` statement is used to output the text "Hello, John Doe!".

**MySQL Syntax:**

MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with databases. Here are some common MySQL commands:

- Creating a Database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

- Creating a Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  ...
);
```

- Inserting Data into a Table:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

- Selecting Data from a Table:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Installation:**

1. PHP Installation:
- Download the PHP package compatible with your operating system from the official PHP website (https://www.php.net/downloads.php).
- Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
- Configure your web server to work with PHP (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

2. MySQL Installation:
- Download the MySQL Community Server from the official MySQL website (https://www.mysql.com/downloads/).
- Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
- During the installation, set the root password for MySQL.
