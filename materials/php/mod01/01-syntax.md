# Introduction to PHP syntax and variables

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language used to develop dynamic websites and web applications. Its syntax is similar to C, Java, and Perl, and it is easy to learn for beginners. Here are some key points about PHP syntax and variables:

Sure, here's a table outlining some important PHP syntax:

| Syntax | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `<?php` and `?>` | Opening and closing PHP tags. PHP code is enclosed between these tags. |
| `//` | Single-line comment syntax in PHP. Anything after `//` on a line is treated as a comment. |
| `/*` and `*/` | Multi-line comment syntax in PHP. Anything between `/*` and `*/` is treated as a comment. |
| `$variable` | Declares a variable in PHP. The `$` sign is always used to indicate a variable. |
| `=` | Assignment operator in PHP. Used to assign a value to a variable. |
| `echo` | Output statement in PHP. Used to display text or variables on the web page. |
| `print` | Alternative output statement in PHP. Used to display text or variables on the web page. |
| `if`, `else if`, `else` | Conditional statements in PHP. Used to execute code based on a condition. |
| `while` | Looping statement in PHP. Used to execute a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true. |
| `for` | Looping statement in PHP. Used to execute a block of code a specified number of times. |
| `foreach` | Looping statement in PHP. Used to iterate over an array or object. |
| `function` | Function declaration in PHP. Used to define a reusable block of code. |
