# PHP: Lab
PHP Lab is a collection of programming projects that provide hands-on experience in developing web applications using PHP and MySQL database. The lab covers a range of projects, from setting up the XAMPP server to developing full-scale applications such as Hospital Management System, Tourism Management System, and COVID19 Testing Management System. The projects also cover important topics such as PHP Intelephense and PHP Server, running PHP on Visual Studio Code, MySQL and image handling, and more. By working through these projects, users can gain valuable experience in PHP development and database management.

| 09a    | PHP POST method            | Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others and has no limits on the amount of information to send.                               | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9post-method.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9post-method.php)                                                             |
| 09b    | PHP GET method             | The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request.                                                                             | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9get-method.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9get-method.php)                                                               |
| 09c    | PHP $_REQUEST variable     | $_REQUEST is an associative array that contains the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE by default.                                                     | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9request-method.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9request-method.php)                                                       |
| 09d    | Sanitizing and Validating  | Sanitization and validation of form fields using PHP have become important aspects of security.                                                              | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9phpValidationExer.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9phpValidationExer.php)                                                 |

## MySQL
| Lesson | Topic | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12a | Connecting to MySQL Database Server | In PHP you can easily do this using the `mysqli_connect()` function. All communication between PHP and the MySQL database server takes place through this connection. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/1connect-to-mysql-database-server.php)|
| 12b | Closing the MySQL Database Server Connection | The connection to the MySQL database server will be closed automatically as soon as the execution of the script ends. However, if you want to close it earlier you can do this by simply calling the PHP `mysqli_close()` function. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/1connect-to-mysql-database-server.php)|
| 12c | Creating MySQL Database Using PHP | Before saving or accessing the data, we need to create a database first. The `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to create a new database in MySQL. Let's make a SQL query using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement, after that we will execute this SQL query through passing it to the PHP `mysqli_query()` function to finally create our database. Database: demo1. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/3create-mysql-database.php)|
| 12d | PHP MySQL Create Tables | A table organizes the information into rows and columns. The SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a table in the database. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/4create-mysql-table.php)|
| 12e | Inserting Data into a MySQL Database Table | The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new rows in a database table. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/5insert-records-into-mysql-database-table.php)|
| 12f | Inserting Multiple Rows into a Table | To do this, include multiple lists of column values within the `INSERT INTO` statement, where column values for each row must be enclosed within parentheses and separated by a comma. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/6insert-multiple-rows-into-table-in-mysql.php)|
| 12g | PHP MySQL Prepared Statements | A prepared statement (also known as a parameterized statement) is simply a SQL query template containing placeholders instead of the actual parameter values. These placeholders will be replaced by the actual values at the time of execution of the statement. Prepared statements also provide strong protection against SQL injection because parameter values are not embedded directly inside the SQL query string. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/7prepared-statement.php)|
| 12h | PHP MySQL Last Inserted ID | For this example, we'll use the same persons table that we've created in the PHP MySQL create tables chapter, which has four columns `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`, where `id` is the primary key column and marked with the AUTO_INCREMENT flag. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/8get-last-inserted-id-from-mysql-database-table.php)|
| 12i | Selecting Data From Database Tables | Now it's time to retrieve data that we have inserted in the preceding tutorial. The SQL `SELECT` statement is used to select records from database tables. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/9mysql-select-query.php)|
| 12j | Filtering the Records | In this tutorial, you will learn how to select records from a MySQL database table based on specific conditions using PHP. The `WHERE` clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/10mysql-where-clause.php)|
| 12k | Limiting Result Sets | The `LIMIT` clause is used to constrain the number of rows returned by the `SELECT` statement. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/11mysql-limit-clause.php)|
| 12l | Ordering the Result Set | The `ORDER BY` clause can be used in conjunction with the `SELECT` statement to see the data from a table ordered by a specific field. The `ORDER BY` clause lets you define the field name to sort against and the sort direction, either ascending or descending. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/12mysql-order-by-clause.php) |
| 12m | Updating Database Table Data | The `UPDATE statement` is used to change or modify the existing records in a database table. This statement is typically used in conjunction with the `WHERE` clause to apply the changes to only those records that match specific criteria.
