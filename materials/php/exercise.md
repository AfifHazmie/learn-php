## [Basic PHP](01-basic.md)
The lab exercise for basic PHP consists of various lessons covering topics such as syntax, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, arrays, and functions. Each lesson focuses on specific subtopics and provides a result in the form of a link to the corresponding exercise file. The exercises involve practical tasks like understanding basic PHP syntax, writing comments, working with variables, utilizing operators, implementing conditional statements and loops, manipulating arrays, and creating functions with or without parameters. These exercises serve as hands-on practice to reinforce understanding and proficiency in PHP programming.

## [Forms](02-form.md)
The lab exercise for PHP forms covers a range of topics. It begins with lessons on the POST and GET methods for sending form data, explaining their differences and usage. The lesson on the PHP `$_REQUEST` variable introduces an associative array that combines the contents of `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE`. The importance of sanitizing and validating form data for security purposes is emphasized in another lesson. Two practical examples are provided: a supply order form and a contact form that collects user feedback. Additionally, the exercise covers file upload functionality and the concept of including common files like headers or footers in multiple web pages. Each lesson includes a brief description and a link to access the corresponding lab exercise.


## MySQL
| Lesson | Topic | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | :------: |
| 12a | [Connecting to MySQL Database Server](../../lab/php/mysql/12a.md) | In PHP you can easily do this using the `mysqli_connect()` function. All communication between PHP and the MySQL database server takes place through this connection. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/1connect-to-mysql-database-server.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12b | [Closing the MySQL Database Server Connection](../../lab/php/mysql/12b.md) | The connection to the MySQL database server will be closed automatically as soon as the execution of the script ends. However, if you want to close it earlier you can do this by simply calling the PHP `mysqli_close()` function. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/1connect-to-mysql-database-server.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12c | [Creating MySQL Database Using PHP](../../lab/php/mysql/12c.md) | Before saving or accessing the data, we need to create a database first. The `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to create a new database in MySQL. Let's make a SQL query using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement, after that we will execute this SQL query through passing it to the PHP `mysqli_query()` function to finally create our database. Database: demo1. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/3create-mysql-database.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12d | [PHP MySQL Create Tables](../../lab/php/mysql/12d.md) | A table organizes the information into rows and columns. The SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a table in the database. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/4create-mysql-table.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12e | [Inserting Data into a MySQL Database Table](../../lab/php/mysql/12e.md) | The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new rows in a database table. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/5insert-records-into-mysql-database-table.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12f | [Inserting Multiple Rows into a Table](../../lab/php/mysql/12f.md) | To do this, include multiple lists of column values within the `INSERT INTO` statement, where column values for each row must be enclosed within parentheses and separated by a comma. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/6insert-multiple-rows-into-table-in-mysql.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12g | [PHP MySQL Prepared Statements](../../lab/php/mysql/12g.md) | A prepared statement (also known as a parameterized statement) is simply a SQL query template containing placeholders instead of the actual parameter values. These placeholders will be replaced by the actual values at the time of execution of the statement. Prepared statements also provide strong protection against SQL injection because parameter values are not embedded directly inside the SQL query string. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/7prepared-statement.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12h | [PHP MySQL Last Inserted ID](../../lab/php/mysql/12h.md) | For this example, we'll use the same persons table that we've created in the PHP MySQL create tables chapter, which has four columns `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`, where `id` is the primary key column and marked with the AUTO_INCREMENT flag. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/8get-last-inserted-id-from-mysql-database-table.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12i | [Selecting Data From Database Tables](../../lab/php/mysql/12i.md) | Now it's time to retrieve data that we have inserted in the preceding tutorial. The SQL `SELECT` statement is used to select records from database tables. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/9mysql-select-query.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12j | [Filtering the Records](../../lab/php/mysql/12j.md) | In this tutorial, you will learn how to select records from a MySQL database table based on specific conditions using PHP. The `WHERE` clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/10mysql-where-clause.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12k | [Limiting Result Sets](../../lab/php/mysql/12k.md) | The `LIMIT` clause is used to constrain the number of rows returned by the `SELECT` statement. Database: demo1, table: persons. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/11mysql-limit-clause.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12l | [Ordering the Result Set](../../lab/php/mysql/12l.md) | The `ORDER BY` clause can be used in conjunction with the `SELECT` statement to see the data from a table ordered by a specific field. The `ORDER BY` clause lets you define the field name to sort against and the sort direction, either ascending or descending. Database: demo1, table: persons. | <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/12mysql-order-by-clause.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12m | [Updating Database Table Data](../../lab/php/mysql/12m.md) | The `UPDATE statement` is used to change or modify the existing records in a database table. This statement is typically used in conjunction with the `WHERE` clause to apply the changes to only those records that match specific criteria. Database: demo1, table: persons. | <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/13mysql-update-query.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 12n | [Deleting Database Table Data](../../lab/php/mysql/12n.md) | Just as you insert records into tables, you can delete records from a table using the `SQL DELETE` statement. It is typically used in conjunction with the `WHERE` clause to delete only those records that match specific criteria or condition. Database: demo1, table: persons. | <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/14mysql-delete-query.php"><img src="../../images/mysql.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |

| 14c | Google Charts: Combo chart | A chart that lets you render each series as a different marker type from the following list: line, area, bars, candlesticks, and stepped area. To assign a default marker type for a series, specify the seriesType property. Use the series property to specify properties of each series individually. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/3gchart_combo.php"><img src="../../images/chart.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 14d | Google Charts: Bubble chart | A bubble chart is used to visualize a data set with two to four dimensions. The first two dimensions are visualized as coordinates, the third as color, and the fourth as size. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/4gchart_bubble.php"><img src="../../images/chart.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 14e | Google Charts: Scatter chart | Scatter charts plot points on a graph. When the user hovers over the points, tooltips are displayed with more information. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/5gchart_scatter.php"><img src="../../images/chart.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 14f | Google Charts: Organization chart | Org charts are diagrams of a hierarchy of nodes, commonly used to portray superior/subordinate relationships in an organization. A family tree is a type of org chart. |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/6gchart_orgc.php"><img src="../../images/chart.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 14g | Google Charts: Word tree | A word tree depicts multiple parallel sequences of words. It could be used to show which words most often follow or precede a target word (e.g., "Cats are...") or to show a hierarchy of terms (e.g., a decision tree). |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/7gchart_word.php"><img src="../../images/chart.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 14g | Google Charts: Dynamic pie chart | If you have a requirement to show the statistics of data with a pie chart, there is an easy way to create the pie chart in the web application. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a dynamic pie chart with PHP and MySQL. DB: demo1, Tables: programming_languages, File: programming_languages.sql |  <a href="http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/mysqlGchart/index.php"><img src="../../images/chart.svg" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 14h | Google Charts: Dynamic pie, bar and column chart | The chart data is dynamic from the database. The database results are used to calculate the statistics to be seen in the graphical view. In the database, it has a table for storing people data with their country name. By grouping people by the country name, the chart will show the statistics about the population of each country.
