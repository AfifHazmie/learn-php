## Forms

| Lesson | Topic | Description | Result |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 09a | PHP POST method | Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others and has no limits on the amount of information to send. | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9post-method.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9post-method.php) |
| 09b | PHP GET method | The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9get-method.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9get-method.php) |
| 09c | PHP $_REQUEST variable | $_REQUEST is an associative array that contains the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE by default. | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9request-method.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9request-method.php) |
| 09d | Sanitizing and Validating Form Data | Sanitization and validation of form fields using PHP have become important aspects of security. | [![File](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9phpValidationExer.php)](http://localhost/msoWP/form/9phpValidationExer.php) |

## MySQL
| Lesson | Topic | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12a | Connecting to MySQL Database Server | In PHP you can easily do this using the `mysqli_connect()` function. All communication between PHP and the MySQL database server takes place through this connection. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/1connect-to-mysql-database-server.php)|
| 12b | Closing the MySQL Database Server Connection | The connection to the MySQL database server will be closed automatically as soon as the execution of the script ends. However, if you want to close it earlier you can do this by simply calling the PHP `mysqli_close()` function. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/1connect-to-mysql-database-server.php)|
| 12c | Creating MySQL Database Using PHP | Before saving or accessing the data, we need to create a database first. The `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to create a new database in MySQL. Let's make a SQL query using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement, after that we will execute this SQL query through passing it to the PHP `mysqli_query()` function to finally create our database. Database: demo1. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/3create-mysql-database.php)|
| 12d | PHP MySQL Create Tables | A table organizes the information into rows and columns. The SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a table in the database. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/4create-mysql-table.php)|
| 12e | Inserting Data into a MySQL Database Table | The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new rows in a database table. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/5insert-records-into-mysql-database-table.php)|
| 12f | Inserting Multiple Rows into a Table | To do this, include multiple lists of column values within the `INSERT INTO` statement, where column values for each row must be enclosed within parentheses and separated by a comma. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/6insert-multiple-rows-into-table-in-mysql.php)|
| 12g | PHP MySQL Prepared Statements | A prepared statement (also known as a parameterized statement) is simply a SQL query template containing placeholders instead of the actual parameter values. These placeholders will be replaced by the actual values at the time of execution of the statement. Prepared statements also provide strong protection against SQL injection because parameter values are not embedded directly inside the SQL query string. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/7prepared-statement.php)|
| 12h | PHP MySQL Last Inserted ID | For this example, we'll use the same persons table that we've created in the PHP MySQL create tables chapter, which has four columns `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`, where `id` is the primary key column and marked with the AUTO_INCREMENT flag. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/8get-last-inserted-id-from-mysql-database-table.php)|
| 12i | Selecting Data From Database Tables | Now it's time to retrieve data that we have inserted in the preceding tutorial. The SQL `SELECT` statement is used to select records from database tables. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/9mysql-select-query.php)|
| 12j | Filtering the Records | In this tutorial, you will learn how to select records from a MySQL database table based on specific conditions using PHP. The `WHERE` clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/10mysql-where-clause.php)|
| 12k | Limiting Result Sets | The `LIMIT` clause is used to constrain the number of rows returned by the `SELECT` statement. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/11mysql-limit-clause.php)|
| 12l | Ordering the Result Set | The `ORDER BY` clause can be used in conjunction with the `SELECT` statement to see the data from a table ordered by a specific field. The `ORDER BY` clause lets you define the field name to sort against and the sort direction, either ascending or descending. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/12mysql-order-by-clause.php) |
| 12m | Updating Database Table Data | The `UPDATE statement` is used to change or modify the existing records in a database table. This statement is typically used in conjunction with the `WHERE` clause to apply the changes to only those records that match specific criteria. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/13mysql-update-query.php) |
| 12n | Deleting Database Table Data | Just as you insert records into tables, you can delete records from a table using the `SQL DELETE` statement. It is typically used in conjunction with the `WHERE` clause to delete only those records that match specific criteria or condition. Database: demo1, table: persons. | [![![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/DBmysql/lesson/14mysql-delete-query.php) |

## Chart.JS and Google Charts
| Lesson | Topic | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13a | Chart.JS: Bar Chart | Bar charts are created by setting type to bar (to flip the direction of the bars, set type to horizontalBar). The colors of the bars are set by passing one color to backgroundColor (all bars will have the same color), or an array of colors. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/chartjs/1chartjs_bar.php) |
| 13b | Chart.JS: Line Chart | Line charts are created by setting type to line. By default, lines come with a dark transparent fill, covering the area between the line and x-axis. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/chartjs/2chartjs_line.php) |
| 13c | Chart.JS: Mixed Chart | You can mix several charts and overlay them on top of each other. This is done by setting type to bar (not to e.g. mixed or line—it has to be bar), and then setting the bar type for every dataset object in your datasets array. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/chartjs/3chartjs_mixed.php) |
| 13d | Chart.JS: Radar Chart | Radar charts, also known as web charts, spider charts, star charts, are created by setting type to radar. Radar charts typically require more vertical space than other graphs to be legible, so you might have to tweak the graph proportions. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/chartjs/4chartjs_radar.php) |
| 13e | Chart.JS: Doughnut Chart | Doughnut charts are created by setting type to doughnut. They are almost identical to pie charts and will work with the same configurations. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/chartjs/5chartjs_doughnut.php) |
| 14a | Google Charts: Pie chart | A pie chart that is rendered within the browser using SVG or VML. Displays tooltips when hovering over slices. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/1gchart_pie.php) |
| 14b | Google Charts: Column chart | A column chart is a vertical bar chart rendered in the browser using SVG or VML, whichever is appropriate for the user's browser. Like all Google charts, column charts display tooltips when the user hovers over the data. For a horizontal version of this chart, see the bar chart. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/2gchart_column.php) |
| 14c | Google Charts: Combo chart | A chart that lets you render each series as a different marker type from the following list: line, area, bars, candlesticks, and stepped area. To assign a default marker type for a series, specify the seriesType property. Use the series property to specify properties of each series individually. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/3gchart_combo.php) |
| 14d | Google Charts: Bubble chart | A bubble chart is used to visualize a data set with two to four dimensions. The first two dimensions are visualized as coordinates, the third as color, and the fourth as size. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/4gchart_bubble.php) |
| 14e | Google Charts: Scatter chart | Scatter charts plot points on a graph. When the user hovers over the points, tooltips are displayed with more information. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/5gchart_scatter.php) |
| 14f | Google Charts: Organization chart | Org charts are diagrams of a hierarchy of nodes, commonly used to portray superior/subordinate relationships in an organization. A family tree is a type of org chart. | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/6gchart_orgc.php) |
| 14g | Google Charts: Word tree | A word tree depicts multiple parallel sequences of words. It could be used to show which words most often follow or precede a target word (e.g., "Cats are...") or to show a hierarchy of terms (e.g., a decision tree). | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/7gchart_word.php) |
| 14g | Google Charts: Dynamic pie chart | If you have a requirement to show the statistics of data with a pie chart, there is an easy way to create the pie chart in the web application. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a dynamic pie chart with PHP and MySQL. DB: demo1, Tables: programming_languages, File: programming_languages.sql | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/mysqlGchart/index.php) |
| 14h | Google Charts: Dynamic pie, bar and column chart | The chart data is dynamic from the database. The database results are used to calculate the statistics to be seen in the graphical view. In the database, it has a table for storing people data with their country name. By grouping people by the country name, the chart will show the statistics about the population of each country. DB: demo1, Tables: tbl_people_country, File: tbl_people_country.sql | [![File](https://example.com/icon.png)](http://localhost/msoWP/googlecharts/mysqlGchart2/index.php) |
