PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source server-side scripting language designed for web development. It was originally created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and has since been maintained and developed by a large community of developers.

PHP code is typically embedded into HTML code, allowing web developers to dynamically generate web pages on the server side. This means that PHP code is executed on the server before the resulting HTML is sent to the client's web browser, allowing for dynamic content and the ability to interact with databases, files, and other server-side resources.

Some key features of PHP include:

- Flexibility: PHP is a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of web development tasks, from simple scripts to full-scale web applications.
- Ease of use: PHP is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a syntax that is similar to C and Perl.
- Cross-platform compatibility: PHP can be run on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
- Interactivity: PHP allows for user input and output, making it possible to create interactive web pages and web applications.
- Scalability: PHP is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle high traffic websites and web applications.

PHP is used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Wikipedia, and WordPress. It is also a popular choice for web development in the enterprise, due to its ease of use and flexibility.
