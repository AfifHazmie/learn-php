HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JS (JavaScript) are three fundamental technologies used for building modern web applications. Here's a brief overview of each:

HTML: HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It uses a set of predefined tags to describe the various elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.

CSS: CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of web pages, including layout, fonts, colors, and other visual effects. It allows web developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and update.

JS: JavaScript is a scripting language used for creating interactive web applications. It runs in the browser and allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to a web page, such as animations, form validation, and user interface components.

In summary, HTML is used for creating the content and structure of web pages, CSS is used for styling and visual presentation, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. All three technologies work together to create modern, responsive, and interactive web applications.
