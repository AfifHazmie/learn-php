# Float
Floats are a CSS property that allow you to position elements to the left or right of their container, which allows content to wrap around them. Here are some key things to know about floats:

- Floats are removed from the normal flow of the document, which means that content that follows a floated element will flow around it. This can be useful for creating multi-column layouts, for example.

- You can float elements to the left or right using the `float` property in CSS. For example, `float: left` will float the element to the left, while `float: right` will float it to the right.

- When you float an element, it becomes a block-level element by default, even if it was originally an inline or inline-block element.

- You can use the `clear` property to ensure that content does not flow around a floated element. For example, `clear: left` will ensure that content appears below any left-floated elements.

- It's important to be aware that floated elements can cause layout issues if not used carefully. For example, if you float too many elements or float them without clearing them properly, you may end up with content overlapping or wrapping in unexpected ways.

It's also worth noting that floats were originally designed for use with images and text, and may not be the best choice for complex layout needs. Alternative layout techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox are often better suited to modern layout requirements.

Finally, it's important to note that while floats are still used in some cases, they are becoming less common in modern web development as newer layout techniques become more widely supported. However, understanding how floats work is still an important part of CSS knowledge.
