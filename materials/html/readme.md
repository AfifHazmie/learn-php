# HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
## Introduction
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a series of tags and attributes that define the elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and tables.

HTML documents are created using a text editor and saved with a .html file extension. The basic structure of an HTML document includes an HTML tag that encloses the entire document, a head tag that contains meta data and links to external resources, and a body tag that contains the content of the web page.

HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page, and can be nested to create more complex layouts. For example, the `<header>` tag can be used to define a page header, and can contain other tags such as `<h1>` for the page title and `<nav>` for a navigation menu.

HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about an element, such as the source file of an image or the action to be taken when a form is submitted. Attributes are added to the opening tag of an element and are specified as name-value pairs, separated by an equals sign.

In addition to the standard HTML elements and attributes, there are also many other elements and attributes provided by HTML5, such as `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`, and `<svg>`, that allow for more advanced multimedia and graphical capabilities.

Overall, HTML is a fundamental language for web development and is used in conjunction with other web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive web pages.

## Standard HTML tags
Here are some standard tags that can be used in HTML:

<html> - indicates the start of an HTML document
<head> - contains meta data and links to external resources
<title> - specifies the title of the web page
<body> - contains the content of the web page
<h1> to <h6> - creates headings of varying sizes
<p> - creates a paragraph of text
<a> - creates a hyperlink to another web page or resource
<img> - embeds an image into the web page
<ul> and <li> - creates an unordered list
<ol> and <li> - creates an ordered list
<table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> - creates a table with rows and columns
<form> - creates a form for user input
<input> - creates various form controls, such as text boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes
<select> and <option> - creates a drop-down list
<button> - creates a button that can be clicked to perform an action

These are just a few of the many HTML tags available. It's important to use them appropriately and according to the standards set forth by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) to ensure that web pages are properly structured and can be viewed consistently across different browsers and devices.
